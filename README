REMARKS:


ANSWERS:
1.
	a. First we will add another parse option in order to acknowledge the 
new input command. second we need to add a new function that will check 
the validity of the parsed command (i.e all argument are correct and legal) 
after that we will send the command to the server to handle.
	b. First we will add the parse option for recognition of the new command. 
then adding a new function to check the group exist and that the client exist
 in the group, then remove the client from the group and remove the group in 
case it got empty. after success a message will be sent back to client.

2. TCP protocol is reliable which means that a message we send will get to its 
destination completely without any missing data. also the TCP protocol will inform 
the sender if the recipient got the message so the sender will not need to double 
send it as a safty net.

3. online FPS games - online First Player Shooting games: usually invole a reach
 and fast response enviroment. this kind of games need to act fast in order
 to provide real time experience.
Video Calls - (fun fact:in the past Skype worked with UDP protocol because of the
 fast response time it had and when the technology got evolved and became faster
 they started to use TCP protocol.) video calls required fast and continually 
sync in order to avoid any delays.

4. We will need to create backup for all data structures like the groups and their 
members and all the clients that was connected to the server. Also saving the 
current state of the server is needed so that the server will be able to restore
 and recover conversations by a log. If anything will be lost it will be all 
the action made in the client side and the action that are currently proccessed 
at the moment by the server.
